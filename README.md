# ASP.NET-Core-and-NoSQL-MongoDB-
This project will be for experimenting and getting more familiar with both .NET Core and NoSQL using MongoDB

04/26/21: This my first time getting to work with NoSql.  I chose to work in MongoDB as it is a popular NoSql database system. 
          I installed MongoDB on my machine, but this database is actually running on Mongo Atlas, the Cloud hosting. This way, anyone can grab the code and test it
          anywhere, once access is given.   
          
          Run this API under localhost<portal>/api/books to see the sample data that is stored in the cloud currently.  This was using sample data I found online.  I am working
          on a API of my own using another Mongo Cluster I have already created for a sample Coffee Shop application.
